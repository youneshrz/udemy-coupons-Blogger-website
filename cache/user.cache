<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this short course, students will&nbsp;<strong>master MATLAB Introductory Course</strong>. They will get familiar with the basic features of calculus and trigonometry&nbsp;<strong>by coding in MATLAB</strong>. They will also&nbsp;<strong>master coding in MATLAB Introductory Course</strong>&nbsp;using 3D coding and some pre-calculus concepts. Many math code have discussed by coding in MATLAB in this course. We will also discuss the math code of different graphics in MATLAB. MATLAB is the software which is prominent in many engineering branches including mathematics. But in this course we are specially going to&nbsp;<strong>master trigonometry by coding in MATLAB</strong>&nbsp;along with geometrical optimization of some linear and non linear programming.</p>

<p>The explanations will be on slides and then the same code will be discuss on MATLAB software. This is short course in MATLAB and I have try my best to make this course useful for the students. They will learn a lot from this course. It is not like I have waste a time without any reason anywhere in the course. All the necessary explanations have been done in this course. I have try to explain the more and more concepts in this 3 hours course.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The same material people offer in 20-30 hours course but I am presenting this course concepts just in 3 hours. Students does&rsquo;t have the time to take 34 hours or more long course to master the MATLAB. The world is more comprehension-ed rather than a typical. So that is why I am offering significant contents for better learning experiences.</p>

<p>The course is very unique due to contents and variety. We will start from very basics and will end on pro level. The main things in this courses is coding by using MATLAB. More than 200 code are there in this course and each code has specific physical orientation as well.</p>

<p>Since optimization plays a great roll in MATLAB. So, many graphics have discuss in this course. We plot many basics functions of mathematics by coding in MATLAB.</p>

<p>Another characteristics of this course is that it will enhance your aptitude ability with logic of mathematical analysis. We can easily check the behavior of some mathematical functions by coding in MATLAB that may be difficult by doing other approaches.</p>

<p>Sketching, plotting and graphing are amazing in MATLAB. We can even find the solution of many abstract equations with their plotting in seconds. In everyday mathematics, we focus on by hand calculations and there are many chances that the calculations may go away from the track but in MATLAB you will find the exact solution of everything and there will be no doubt in every calculations which will be done through MATLAB.</p>

<p><strong>MONEY BACK GUARANTEE</strong></p>

<p>It is not like that I have wasted the time anywhere in the course. I am giving you the genuine course contents presentations. So I promise you that you will not waste your money. Also Udemy has 30 day money back guarantee and if you feel that the course is not like that you were looking, then you can take your money back.</p>
